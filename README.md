# SQL-Task-Solutions
I use this repository to post SQL practice exercises and their solutions in order to build and enhance my portfolio
Here, I will be working with the **Oracle Database Sample Schemas 23c**.  
You can explore the structure of the database via this link:  
[Oracle Database Sample Schemas Diagrams](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/comsc/schema-diagrams.html#GUID-D268A4DE-BA8D-428E-B47F-80519DC6EE6E)
and my https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/nigarmajidzada account

I will record and share each task in a separate SQL file, noting the **problem name** for reference.  
Each problem will be described in detail as a **comment** within the SQL file.
